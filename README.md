# Sediment Mixing Analysis - Mataquito River
This repository contains the analytical framework and computational notebooks for sediment mixing analysis in the Mataquito River system, supporting research on sediment provenance and transport dynamics.
### Project Overview
This project investigates sediment mixing processes through multi-proxy analysis combining detrital zircon geochronology, cosmogenic nuclide analysis, and geomorphological assessment. The analysis integrates fertility calculations, spatial watershed analysis, and mixing model scenarios to quantify sediment provenance and transport mechanisms.
